#   This directory contains all games that can be used as a            #
#   template in `/bm create`. Games copied into this directory will    #
#   not be loaded. Template files should end in `.game.zip`            #
#                                                                      #
#   To make a copy of a templated game, run:                           #
#            \bm create <name> -schem=t:<file>.game.zip                #
#                                                                      #
#   A templated game is the exact same file as a normal game,          #
#   except that it is stored in this folder. Thus, to share a game     #
#   you've created, simply copy the game's zip file.                   #
#                                                                      #
#   This file is automatically generated and will be reset on next     #
#   server reload.                                                     #
#                                                                      #
