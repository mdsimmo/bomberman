  # Bomberman has four types of blocks:
  #  1. indestructible: tnt will not effect the block
  #  2. destructible: tnt will destroy the block, but progress no further
  #  3. pass-keep: tnt will pass through the block without changing the blocks state.
  #                Players inside pass-keep blocks will still be hit
  #  4. pass-destroy: tnt will pass through the block, ignite the block, then change into air
  #
  # Unless set otherwise:
  #  * All solid blocks are indestructible
  #  * All non-solid blocks are pass-destroy.
  # A solid block is defined as a block that has any hitbox that blocks the players movement
  #
  # All types will drop loot when destroyed if they are assigned in loot-table
  #
  # The assigned tnt fire type and air types are always pass-destroy and cannot be altered
  #
  # Note: The in-game configuration gui will "smart add" similar material ids (e.g wall_sign and sign).
  #  You have to add similar ids manually here

  # Blocks tnt will explode the first block of
  # Generally, blocks that are in the loot-table should be destructible
  # Removing tnt from destructible means tnt explosions will not chain together
  destructible:
    - TNT
    - SNOW_BLOCK
    - DIRT
    - SAND
    - GRAVEL
    - SANDSTONE
