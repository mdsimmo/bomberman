#                BOMBERMAN TEMPORARY DIRECTORY                      #
#                                                                   #
#   This directory contains temporary data for Bomberman's          #
#   operation.                                                      #
#                                                                   #
#   Two directories exist:                                          #
#     - game:                                                       #
#          Data cached for a game. This decreases the server        #
#          restart time as less data needs to be read and processed #
#     - players:                                                    #
#          Data about the status of a player before they joined a   #
#          Bomberman game. This stores e.g. inventory, health,      #
#          location, etc. The file is used in-case the server       #
#          crashes or shutdowns un-expectantly.                     #
#                                                                   #
#   This file is automatically generated and will be reset on next  #
#   server reload.                                                  #
#                                                                   #
